# Angular-Sample-App
Code sample for Angular development

I'll be the first to admit, this isn't a really impressive app.  But it does demonstrate several important front end development needs as they pertain to Angular.  The use of UI routing, creating and using a service to get external data, a few features of EC 6 incuding the Const and Let variables, and the observable data type as well as the use of Bootstrap for styling.  Try not to be too hard on me :)

Installation and running the app: 
- Download the zip file and extract it
- open a command line or terminal
- navigate (cd) to the m-w-c-app folder
- type "ng serve" and hit enter
- open a browser and navigate to: http://localhost:4200
